# echoPi
Alexa ECHO + raspberry PI = echoPi

echoPi idea came few months back when I started seeing Amazon Alexa ads on TV. To be honest, I felt like buying it but then I saw the price :-)

I do listen to music every day in the morning on my TV. I though it would be cool if I could voice control the songs to play. So I decided to build one myself.

To know how I built it, check out my block post: http://abhijitbangera.com/echopi-alexa-echo-raspberry-pi/

### Hardware Requirements:
RaspberyPi 

Headphone/mic for voice input

Speakers for audio output


### How to use:
1. To ask a question, append the word "jarvis" before the question. Example: Jarvis who is the president of India?

2. To play a song, simple say "play" followed by the song name. Example: Play Hello

3. To stop a song from playing, simply say "stop". 

### Video Demo:

Known issue:
1. After playing audio song, some time speech recognization gets hanged.

Note: 
Depending on your internet speed and hardware quality, the time take to play song will be longer than as shown in the demo video. It can take from few seconds to few minutes to play a song.
